# VGA-Controller-with-Accelerometer-Interface
BASYS3 FPGA based VGA Controller with Digilent PmodACL2 3-axis Accelerometer Interface

The attached zip-file includes the complete project, where the design was implemented using Vivado 2014.4.
All necessary source-files (vhdl and constraint files) can be found in the zip-file, if one wants to add them to their own project. 

The HDL-design consists of a VGA Controller and an Accelerometer Interface. When implemented on a Basys3 FPGA board, with a VGA cable connected to a monitor, accelerometer data can be outputted on the monitor.
